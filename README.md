## 📘 What You’ll Learn

This repository breaks down the most **crucial Pandas operations** used in real-world data analysis, business intelligence, and machine learning workflows.

### ✅ Key Topics Covered:

- **📌 Creation of DataFrames**  
  Learn how to create Pandas DataFrames from lists, dictionaries, NumPy arrays, and external files (CSV, Excel).

- **📌 Exploring Data**  
  Understand dataset structure using `.info()`, `.shape`, `.head()`, `.describe()` and check column data types.

- **📌 Handling Duplicate Values**  
  Identify and remove duplicate rows using `.duplicated()` and `.drop_duplicates()`.

- **📌 Working with Missing Data**  
  Detect, drop, or fill missing values (`NaN`) using `.isnull()`, `.fillna()`, `.dropna()` for clean and consistent data.

- **📌 Column Transformation**  
  Rename, replace, map, and apply custom functions on columns to transform your dataset the smart way.

- **📌 GroupBy Operations**  
  Summarize and analyze grouped data using aggregation (`sum()`, `mean()`, `count()`, etc.).

- **📌 Merge, Join & Concatenate**  
  Combine multiple datasets horizontally or vertically with Pandas’ powerful data joining methods.

- **📌 Comparing DataFrames**  
  Compare two DataFrames element-wise and understand what changed.

- **📌 Pivoting & Melting**  
  Reshape data from wide to long format and vice versa using `pivot()`, `pivot_table()`, and `melt()`.
